/*
 * This tutorial gives you an introduction on how to write specifications with Jnario.
 * Jnario Specs are based on [Xtend](http://www.xtend-lang.org). it might be a good idea
 * to read the Xtend [documentation](http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/documentation/index.html) as well, 
 * because Jnario's expressions, fields, methods and extensions work exactly as in Xtend.

	/*
	 * First of all you need a running installation of Jnario. If you haven't installed 
	 * Jnario yet, follow the [install guide](../../jnario/documentation/InstallingJnarioSpec.html).
	 * To get started create a new specification using the spec wizard
	 * (**File** -> **New** -> **Other** -> **Jnario** -> **Spec**).
	 * 
	 * <p align="center"><img src="/img/tutorial/spec_wizard.png" alt="New Spec Wizard"/></p>
	 *  
	 * <span class="label label-info">Tip</span> If the editor shows a validation error, 
	 * because of the missing jnario libraries, add them 
 	 * to the classpath using the quickfix (CMD/Ctrl + 1).
 	 * 
	 * In Jnario we *describe facts* about our program. Here are two simple facts about a stack:
	 * 
	 * <pre class="prettyprint lang-spec">
	 * describe "A Stack"{
	 *   fact "initial size is 0" 
	 *   fact "increases its size when pushing an element"
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 *  
	 * To execute this specification, right click
	 * in the editor and select **Run As** -> **JUnit Test**. 
	 * The specification will
	 * pass, but the facts in our specification will be marked as _PENDING_ as they are not implemented yet.
	 * 
	 * <pre class="prettyprint lang-none">A Stack
	 *   - initial size is 0 [PENDING]
	 *   - increases its size when pushing an element [PENDING]
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * In the background, Jnario automatically translates the stack specification into a JUnit test case `AStackSpec.java` 
	 * in the `xtend-gen` folder.

		 * a block expression to your facts.
		 * We use `=>` to describe the expected result of an expression. For 
		 * example, `new Stack.size => 0` will fail if the size is not `0`.
		 * If we execute our specification we will see that all specifications
		 * pass and that they are not marked as _PENDING_ anymore. You can also mark *facts* explicitly as

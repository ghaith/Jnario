Feature: Using JUnit Rules in Features

You can use [JUnit rules](http://kentbeck.github.com/junit/javadoc/latest/org/junit/rules/TestRule.html) in your feature. Just define a field with the `@Rule` annotation
like you would do in a normal JUnit test case. 

	Scenario: Using JUnit Rules 
		CharSequence jnarioFile
		When I have a feature with JUnit rules
			'''
				package demo
				import org.junit.Rule
				import org.junit.rules.TemporaryFolder
				
				Feature:  JUnit Rules
				
					Scenario: Using rules in a Feature
						@Rule public val folder = new TemporaryFolder
					
						Given a feature with a rule
						Then the rule should be initialized
							folder.root should not be null	
			'''
			jnarioFile = args.first
		Then it should execute successfully
